Wrap me in a bolt of lightning
Send me on my way still smiling
Maybe that's the way I should go
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left a spare key on the table
I never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
I lost my whole life and a dear friend
I've said it so many times
I would change my way
No nevermind
God knows I've tried
