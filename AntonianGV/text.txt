Wrap me in a bolt of lightning
Send me on my way still smiling
Maybe that's the way I should go
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left a spare key on the table
I never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
I lost my whole life and a dear friend 
I've said it so many times
A would change my ways
No, nevermind
God knows I've tried
Call me a sinner
Call me a saint
Tell me it's over
I'll still love you the same
Call me your favourite
Call me the worst
Tell me it's over
I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
