Wrap me in a bolt of lightning
Send me on my way still smiling
Maybe that's the way I should go
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left a spare key on the table
I never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
Straight into the mouth of the unknown
I left a spare key on the table
I never really thought I'd be able
To say I merely visit on the weekends
I lost my whole life and a dear friend
The angels and the pearls
I've said it so many times
I would change my way
No nevermind
God knows I've tried
Call me a sinner
Call me a saint
Tell me it's over
I'll still love you the same
Call me your favourite
Call me the worst
Tell me it's over
I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
I finally put it all together
That nothing really lasts forever
I had to make a choice that was not mine
I had to say goodbye for the last time
I put my life in a suitcase
Never really stayed in one place
Maybe that's the way it should be
You know I've lived my life like a gypsy
I've said it so many times
I would change my ways, no never mind
God knows I tried
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me its over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite
Call me the worst
Tell me its over I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
I'll always keep you inside
You healed my heart and my life
And you know I've tried
Call me a sinner, call me a saint
Tell me its over, I'll still love you the same
Call me your favorite
Call me the worst
Tell me its over I don't want you to hurt
It's all that I can say
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way
So I'll be on my way
I'll follow you

If I could find assurance to leave you behind
I know my better half would fade
And all my doubt is a staircase for you
Opened out of this maze
The first step is the one you believe in
The second one might be profound

I'll follow you down through the eye of the storm
Don't worry I'll keep you warm
I'll follow you down while we're passing through space
I don't care if we fall from grace
I'll follow you down
You can have the money and the world
The angels and the pearls
Even trademark the color blue
Just like the tower we never built
